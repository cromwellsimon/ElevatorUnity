# ElevatorUnity
Unity remake of Elevator: Source made in 2019.

I had made the source code available for this back in 2019 but am now getting around to putting it up on GitHub.
This project will likely have difficulty starting up since I have removed most of the assets that were not mine for the GitHub release (music that came from the original game, SpeedTrees, etc.),
but I'd expect all the C# files and the Blender files to be present.
The original source code with nothing removed is still available for download if desired from here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1p0fhtVhWDq2m1NANEuHZYsZ3JaN3meYx?usp=sharing
